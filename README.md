# advent 22
This repo holds my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/).

This is the first year I'm doing it and I'm quite excited. I'm also using this opportunity to learn Rust. I'm new to Rust. So please reserve judgment on the quality of my code. I'm still learning. But, I hope that my Rust programming skills are a lot better by day 25!
